# /// Naked /// Niroo /// - Autocheckout Bot for NakedCPH

*NOTE: This program is made for Python 3.X.X!

This is a simple Python bot which uses Selenium to navigate the website [http://www.nakedcph.com/](http://www.nakedcph.com/)  and quickly checkout shoe orders. Although the script was written with the specific intention of making shoe orders, there is nothing stopping users from checking out other items on the site through the script. Users can configure how many orders they want to make, including the credit card info to use and various items to checkout within each order by editing the included checkout.conf JSON file. The script is configured to use the PhantomJS headless webdriver, which is included as a NodeJS dependency. Chromedriver is also included as a dependency in the case that you don't want to use a headless webdriver.
